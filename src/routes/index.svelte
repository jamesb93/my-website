I am a composer, sound artist and creative-coder from Perth, Western Australia. I enjoy working with programming in my practice and harnessing the computer to find, organise and create taxonomies of corpora through machine listening and learning. As of 2017, I am a PhD student under the supervision of <a href="http://www.alexanderjharker.co.uk">Alex Harker </a>and <a href="https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/persons/steven-jan">Steven Jan</a> at the University of Huddersfield.

I also run the <a href="https://www.hudhack.space">Creative Coding Hackspace</a> that is loosely attached to the Huddersfield Creative Coding Lab.
