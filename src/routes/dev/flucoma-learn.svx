# Fluid Corpus Manipulation Learn Platform

As part of my role on the <a target='_blank' href='https://flucoma.org'>Fluid Corpus Manipulation (FluCoMa)</a> project I devise (with amazing colleagues) a series of docs and resources  to enable techno-fluent musicians with our toolkit. Toward this, I am responsible for designing and maintaining a framework enabling our team to author content for the <a target='_blank' href='https://learn.flucoma.org'>FluCoMa Learn Platform</a>. The platform's goal is to provide a rich resource that hosts explanations of FluCoMa toolkit algorithms, tutorials and community portraits of advanced use-cases. Where possible we support this content with interactive widgets leveraging technologies such as <a href='https://ptsjs.org/'>pts.js</a>, <a href='https://tonejs.github.io/'>Tone.js</a>, <a href='https://www.chartjs.org/'>Chart.js</a> and <a href='https://d3js.org/'>D3.js</a> and multimedia formats. All of this content is indexed in a searchable lightweight database that is dynamically built from the content itself at build time, aiding discovery and navigation. 


At its core, the platform is built on <a target='_blank' href='https://kit.svelte.dev/'>SvelteKit</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/'>MDsveX</a>. SvelteKit makes the development experience fast and keeps the payload of the website small and manageable in our team. Combined with MDsveX and a custom frontmatter parser, all of our content lives in <code>.svx</code> files. This makes the workflow abstracted: I develop the backbone of the application while the shape of the content exists in a readable markdown format that allows mixing in javascript and HTML where necessary. An example reference in the site looks like [this](https://github.com/flucoma/learn-website/blob/main/src/routes/reference/chroma.svx).

The deployment and collaboration of the site is backed by git and GitHub actions. Everytime a topic/feature branch is merged to main, the site is built and deployed to a digital ocean droplet over rsync. This enables us to work collaboratively with minimal friction as well as make contribution relatively simple beyond the life of the project.
