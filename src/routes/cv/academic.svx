It is currently tendering additional funding via the Arts Council Projects Grant. The project is focused on creating distributed and decentralised methods for collaborating and learning music. I am responsible for creating the web-based application, which allows people to join "rooms" and interact wth a variety of rhythmic transformations and synthesis modules together across the world.

**ReaCoMa**

ReaCoMa began as a personal project to port the Fluid Corpus Manipulation (FluCoMa) tools to REAPER through the ReaScript API. This allows those machine listening and learning algorithms to be used directly in composition as well as exposing a set of APIs so that others can leverage the library in their own creative workflow. I was given funding internally at the University of Huddersfield  to open source the project, create documentation, a video tutorial series (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24VF9uE4sU75xI3U4K6EoA), and make the tool more widely accessible to researchers who might not be proficient with Max, SuperCollider or Pure Data for which there are existing versions of the FluCoMa tools. https://www.reacoma.xyz

**FluCoMa Community**

Since the start of the FluCoMa project I have been a part of the online community involved in providing feedback and generating discussion around the tools produced by the FluCoMa team at the University of Huddersfield. Through this community I have submitted numerous patches and engaged in discourse around user experience, interface design and electronic music composition. ReaCoMa has had significant impact and reach through this medium, and many of the commissioned composers have used my patches and tools built around the FluCoMa ecosystem.

I was employed to create documentation and a tutorial learning system allowing musicians with a wide range of competencies to become proficient with FrameLib. FrameLib allows composers and creative coders to create custom digital signal processing routines with frame-based processing such as for granular synthesis, spectral processing and audio descriptors. The tutorials were created in Max and have been distributed as a package to a large global community. More information here: https://github.com/alexharker/FrameLib.

In my residency I wrote a piece using a large databases of vocal phonetic samples and received mentorship from Dr. Kerry Hagan, the principal researcher at the SpADE. The piece that was composed came to fruition at a much a later date in a piece presented in 2019 at the Electric Spring Festival in the United Kingdom.

## Teaching Experience

#### Final Year Project (University of Huddersfield)
Tutoring individual students in a 1-on-1 capacity to provide feedback and guide them through the process of creating a substantial creative project. Through this module I have advised on a variety of music genres including classical orchestral composition, soul, hip-hop, metal, punk, progressive rock and electronic music.

#### DMP1 - Desktop Music Production (University of Huddersfield)
Delivering seminars and lectures on techniques and technologies for computer-based music production including sequencing, sampling, arrangement, and a variety of sound processing techniques. A range of assessments, both technically or creatively focused develops their critical listening and production skills and seminars support them in applying these techniques to a range of individual aesthetics.

#### SAE1 - Sonic Arts and Electronica (University of Huddersfield)
Delivering seminars that introduce students to a broad range of electronic music styles and genres and technologies (Max, VCV Rack) in sonic art. Various genres are covered from IDM, EDM, acousmatic and sound installation work. includes For each student, the module culminates in the submission of a creative portfolio that encourages them to demonstrate the use of technology in imaginative ways. Throughout the year, I provide feedback to them and advise how they can develop their creative workflow, fostering their development as artists.

#### SAE2 - Sonics Arts and Electronica (University of Huddersfield)
This is a follow on module from SAE1 and is designed for students who completed SAE1 to take on more responsibility developing their practice, while giving them the opportunity to explore more personal aesthetic and creative goals across a variety of electronic based genres. Seminars delved into more complicated or hard to grasp subject matter ranging from sound design, studio practice and compositional technique. I also wrote a series of 6 lectures focusing on topics such as glitch aesthetics, interactive computer-based composition, genre-breaking artists in electronic music and developing creative workflow

#### MUSC1055 - Electronic Music: Methods and Means (University of Western Australia)
Providing seminars covering a wide range of electronic music genres. The seminars focus on exposing students to compositional strategies in these works and how composers outside mainstream genres of music approach structuring and designing music.

<div slot="right">

Biomimicry is an interactive real-time system written in Max. Using audio features to analyse the performerâ€™s sound input and a "faulty" memory to store this information, the system creates intense and machine like responses to the human musician. Each CD that was released contained a different instance of Biomimicry in collaboration with two performers, Dan Oâ€™Connor and Sage Pbbbt.
