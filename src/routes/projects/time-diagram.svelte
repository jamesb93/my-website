<h1>Time Diagram For The Non-Dimensional Listener</h1>

<p>
	Time Diagram For The Non-Dimensional Listener is a project created and composed by <a
		href="http://www.markfell.com/wiki">Mark Fell</a
	>. I aided Mark by creating a web application designed specifically for the performance. Users
	navigated to a page on their phone and entered their ticket number. This assigns them a sound to
	be played back from their devices, attaching this to them throughout the performance.
	Approximately 150 participants were involved, creating phasing and interferences between users
	across a distributed and complex space.
