<h1>Reconstruction Error</h1>

<p>
    Reconstruction Error focuses on the harnessing of microscopic clicks, fuzzes and glitches harvested from my converting raw data on my computer into audio files. The album is an artefact, and a momentary capture of my engagement with these sounds â€” drawing to the foreground the ephemeral and gentle nature that is embedded in the detritus produced by computers.

    I began writing this album by scraping raw data from my hard drive and converting it to WAV audio files. I originally performed this with the <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net">SoX command-line program</a> and eventually <a href="https://github.com/jamesb93/mosh">mosh</a>, a tool I wrote with the help of Francesco Cameli. This generated around 20000 files of mostly noise. The album emerged from this self inflincted problem as I developed methods for filtering, searching and querying this unwieldy corpus of sounds for those with novel qualities, morphologies and sonic behaviours.

    This technology-led creative process spawned the first version of <a href="https://github.com/jamesb93/ftis">FTIS (Finding Things In Stuff)</a>, a framework for orchestrating machine listening and machine learning for computer-aided composition.
